ðŸ§  MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project uses the MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark in machine learning and computer vision, to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9). It demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model capable of classifying images of digits with high accuracy.

ðŸš€ Features

Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset

Builds and trains a neural network using numpy and scipy as key libraries

Evaluates accuracy on test data

Visualizes predictions

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains:

60,000 training images

10,000 testing images

Each image is 28Ã—28 pixels, grayscale, representing digits 0â€“9

ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with the highest possible accuracy using a shallow neural network.
